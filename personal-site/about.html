            <p class="about-section"> My name is Spencer Hurd. I'm a 20-year-old future web developer originally from New Jersey, now living in Texas :(.
                Before seeking an education and career in coding, I was a music instructor for two years, teaching vocals, piano, guitar,
                bass, and drums to students of all ages, as well as directing larger groups of students in a band setting. I love all types of music,
                but primarily listen to mid-20th-century blues. While teaching music, I went to art school for some time to attain a degree in Painting/Drawing,
                but decided against pursuing a four-year degree. I have a cat named Circuit whom most people call "Sir Cat" (or these days, "Sir Fat"!), and a 
                half-blind chihuahua mutt named Wylie, as well as a bearded dragon named Grogu. I don't know what else to put here, so I'm going to Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
